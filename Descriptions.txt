A description of which aspects of this project work ok and which do not work ok, if any.

- The Person Class takes a little longer than it should, to create an instantiation, 
because it uses bigger numbers to create the Public Keys and Private Keys. //Dylan Chow

- Inverse method has issues with trying to divide by zero with current implementation. //Geoff Cohen

A description of what you would do to improve this work if you had more time.

- I would have liked to have spent more time trying to figure out a faster way to create a 
Person object and ensure a better public and private key. //Dylan Chow

- I would have liked more time to experiment with the driver. //Geoff Cohen
