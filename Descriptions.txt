A description of which aspects of this project work ok and which do not work ok, if any.

- The Person Class takes a little longer than it should, to create an instantiation,

A description of what you would do to improve this work if you had more time.

- I would have liked to have spent more time trying to figure out a faster way to create a 
Person object and ensure a better public and private key. //Dylan Chow
